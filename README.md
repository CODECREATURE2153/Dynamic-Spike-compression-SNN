# Dynamic Spike Compression SNN

## Overview

This repository presents an innovative approach to improving the energy efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) by reducing unnecessary spikes using a novel event-driven technique: **Dynamic Spike Compression (DSC)**. The DSC algorithm selectively removes redundant spikes, resulting in substantial reductions in spike rate and energy consumption.

- **Energy Efficiency**: Achieves up to **31.32% improvement** in energy efficiency compared to baseline SNNs.
- **Spike Rate Reduction**: Lowers spike rate by **39%**.
- **Spike Count Reduction**: Reduces total spikes by **31.4%** compared to baseline SNNs.

## Contents

- **Baseline SNN**: Reference implementation of standard SNNs for direct comparison.
- **DSC-SNN**: Implementation of the Dynamic Spike Compression algorithm in SNNs.
- All code is provided in **Jupyter Notebook** format for clarity and reproducibility.

## Key Features

- **Event-Driven Spike Compression**: Removes unnecessary spikes in real-time, optimizing network performance.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Includes both baseline and DSC-SNN implementations for quantitative comparison.
- **Metrics & Results**: Demonstrates clear improvements in spike rate and energy efficiency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Standard scientific computing libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CODECREATURE2153/Dynamic-Spike-compression-SNN.git
Install required dependencies (if any are listed in the notebooks).

Usage
Open the notebooks using Jupyter:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Run the baseline SNN notebook for reference results.

Run the DSC-SNN notebook to observe the improvements from dynamic spike compression.

Results
The DSC algorithm demonstrates:

✅ Up to 31.32% energy efficiency improvement

✅ 39% reduction in spike rate

✅ 31.4% fewer spikes compared to baseline SNN

All results, code, and comparative analyses are included in the notebooks.
